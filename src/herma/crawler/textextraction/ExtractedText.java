/**
 * Provides access to the text extracted from a document
 * as well as some meta-data concerning the extraction.
 * <p>
 * The document text may be split into text passages.
 * Splitting the document text into passages happens
 * at a text extractorâ€™s discretion. It is possible that
 * an extractor always returns only one text passage
 * (which contains the whole document text). 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Splitting the document text into text passages is a <i>hint</i>
 * that these passages should be processed separately and
 * independently of each other (for instance, in a linguistic
 * processing pipeline) in spite of belonging to the same document.
 * The order of the text passages matters and should be preserved
 * by further processing steps.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Through this interface, the extracted text passages can be accessed
 * as {@link String} instances ({@link #getTexts()})
 * or as (temporary) files ({@link #getTempFilesPaths()}).
 * Hence, it has to be ensured that these files are deleted
 * after their usage (to avoid resource leaks).
 * {@link #removeTempFiles()} ensures that none of the
 * temporary files which {@link #getTempFilesPaths()} would return
 * remains on disk, so {@link #removeTempFiles()} should be called
 * when the files are not needed anymore.
 * (If the files are needed beyond the potential lifetime
 * of the respective {@link ExtractedText} instance,
 * their disposal has to be ensured by other means.)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If no temporary files are needed at all
 * (and the result of {@link #getTempFilesPaths()}
 * is never needed), it is advisable to use
 * {@link #removeTempFiles()} instead of calling
 * {@link #getTempFilesPaths()} just to delete the
 * returned files, as the implementation may
 * not have to create them in the first place.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Any <i>other</i> cleanup the implementation has to perform
 * happens in {@link #cleanup()}, so that method should
 * <i>always</i> be called when an instance of
 * {@link ExtractedText} is not needed anymore.
