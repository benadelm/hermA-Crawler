hermACrawler Licence
====================

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this licence document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
--------

This is the licence for the web crawler developed in the research
project hermA at the University of Hamburg. It is based on the
Mozilla Public License 2.0, but differs from it in several points.

First, the software is intended for non-commercial, non-profit
use only, like in a private or academic context: This licence does
not allow you to exploit it for making money.

Second, it contains additional terms and clarifications to account
for some issues specific to a web crawler: This licence explicitly
denies any grant of rights to data the crawler downloads from the
Internet and (possibly) saves, and it disclaims any responsibility
(and thus liability) of the contributors for any adverse
consequences of downloading that data, for example in case that it
is illegal to obtain or own such data.

To ensure that these requirements are not circumvented and the
legal protection remains in place, this licence is a so-called
copyleft licence: It requires everyone to retain all the conditions
imposed by this licence when passing on or modifying the software.
However, this licence is not intended to limit your freedom to
choose desirable terms for your own software. Therefore, unlike
strong copyleft licences like the GNU General Public License, it
does not require you to publish your own code under the same
licence if it is built on this software.

A record of the differences to the Mozilla Public License
and the precise terms of this licence follow.

2. Licence Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive licence:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, have made,
    import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its
    Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licences granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licences granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this Licence. No additional rights or licences will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this Licence.
No patent licence is granted by a Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This Licence does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

The web documents which the web crawler retrieves and possibly saves,
such as web pages in HTML or any other format, PDF documents, as well as
any other data, are not covered by this licence; they might be subject
to their own licence (or to no licence at all). Any user of the web
crawler hereby assumes sole responsibility for complying with the
copyright and licence terms of downloaded data.

2.4. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this Licence.

2.5. Fair Use

This Licence is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.6. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licences granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this Licence. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
Licence, and You must provide them with a copy of this Licence. You
may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the
Source Code Form.

If You create any Modifications to Covered Software, You must prominently
declare that you modified something, what you modified, and when you
modified it. The information when you modified Covered Software must be
precise enough that the order of all modifications can be unambiguously
reconstructed. It should include at least the year of modification.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at no charge; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form only under the terms of
    this Licence.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work provided that Covered
Software remains under this licence, but the parts of the Larger Work
that are not Covered Software may be under terms of Your choice.

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any licence notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any licence notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Non-Commercial, Non-Profit Use Only

You may not charge any price or fee for Covered Software or make any
profit or gain any benefit in terms of money from Your permission to
reproduce, make available, distribute or otherwise exploit Covered
Software. In particular, You may not sell Covered Software.

You may charge a fee for Your own efforts working on and with Covered
Software, such as running Covered Software on behalf of someone else,
carrying out requested modifications, or creating a Larger Work,
provided that You unasked and unambiguously communicate that any prices
You charge do not pertain to Covered Software, that Covered Software can
be obtained free of charge, and where it can be obtained. Under this
condition You may also sell those parts of a Larger Work that are not
Covered Software, but you may not sell any parts that are Covered
Software, including any modifications You have made.

3.6. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If conditions are imposed on You (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this Licence, they do not
excuse You from the conditions of this Licence. If you cannot perform
an action without violating either the terms of this Licence or any
other obligations, then as a consequence you may not perform that action
at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect
a royalty for further distributing from those to whom you distribute
Covered Software, the only way to satisfy both those terms and this
Licence would be to refrain entirely from distributing Covered Software.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this Licence will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this Licence from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this Licence
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice. If all Your rights under this Licence
terminate, You agree to cease use and distribution of Covered Software
as soon as reasonably practicable.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this Licence shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user licence agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this Licence
prior to termination shall survive termination.

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this Licence may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

If the defendant is a Contributor, such a litigation relating to this
Licence may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the
defendant maintained its principal place of business at the point in
time when that Contributor's Contribution was made. Such litigation
shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to
its conflict-of-law provisions.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This Licence represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. Except as expressly stated above, You receive no rights
or licences to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
Licence, whether expressly, by implication or otherwise. All rights in
Covered Software not expressly granted under this Licence are reserved.
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Licence.

If any provision of this Licence is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this Licence against a Contributor.

10. Modified Versions
---------------------

If you create software not governed by this Licence, and you want to
create a new licence for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this Licence if you rename the licence.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form Licence Notice
-------------------------------------------

  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the hermACrawler
  Licence. If a copy of the licence was not distributed with this
  file, You have received this Source Code Form in a manner that does
  not comply with the terms of the licence.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
for such a notice.
